### The aim of this website is to promote Ireland as a travel destination.The Emerald Isle is fantastic for road trips, for hiking, discovering castles, eating seafood and sipping on whiskey. On top of the many buzzing cities, you could also explore the natural wonders and quaint villages that make up the countryside. It may conjure up images of green rolling hills, rugged seaside cliffs, and windswept rock formations. When you visit this Celtic country, you will be rewarded with all that and more!
